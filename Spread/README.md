How to run the spread calculator:
- Place the obtained pareto fronts in ./Obtained_PF (make sure you follow the nameing convention)
- Place the true pareto fronts in ./True_PF (make sure you follow the nameing convention)
- Run the script to obtain the spread of the obtained pareto frontier (python Spread.py)

Note: Naming convention is ModelName(Number_of_objectives)-PF.txt
